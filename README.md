# Roleplaying
This repository contains the cleaned up version of Ansible roles (roleplaying,
ha-ha get it?) that I wrote for my own use and deem (potentially) useful for
the rest of the world.

Roles in this repository:
	* Authoritative DNS (Configures a machine running Debian as an authoritative nameserver through `nsd`, zonefiles can be managed with the role as well)
